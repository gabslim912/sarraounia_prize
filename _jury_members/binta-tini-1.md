  to boost reading. Her steadfastness, search for knowledge and work with publishers
  and actors in the book trade, and her involvement with the Caravane du Livre et

  and region for more than a decade. Binta Tini is a member of the International Association
  of Francophone Booksellers (AILF) and founding member and treasurer of the Association
